Objective :

I Performed a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. Focus is on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types. I used different Python libraries such as NumPy,  Pandas, SciPy,  matplotlib ,scikit-learn to complete the given analysis and visualization tasks.



Analysis Tasks to be performed:

Import a 311 NYC service request.
Read or convert the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and create a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request creation and request closing. (Hint: Explore the package/module datetime)
Provide major insights/patterns that you can offer in a visual format (graphs or tables); at least 4 major conclusions that you can come up with after generic data mining.
Order the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.
